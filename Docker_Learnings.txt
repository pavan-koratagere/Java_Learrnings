Types of hypervisors
There are 2 different types of hypervisors that can be used for virtualization.

Type 1 Hypervisor
A type 1 hypervisor is on bare metal. VM resources are scheduled directly to the hardware by the hypervisor. 
KVM is an example of a type 1 hypervisor. KVM was merged into the Linux® kernel in 2007, so if you’re using a modern version of Linux, you already have access to KVM. 

Type 2
A type 2 Hypervisor is hosted. VM resources are scheduled against a host operating system, which is then executed against the hardware. 
VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox are examples of type 2 Hypervisors.

what is a bare minimum Container runtime consists of
Containers are fundamentally composed of several underlying kernel primitives: 
1) namespaces - who you are allowed to talk to
2) cgroups    - the amount of resources you are allowed to use
3) LSMs       -(Linux Security Modules—what you are allowed to do).
