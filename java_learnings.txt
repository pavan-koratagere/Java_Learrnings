J2EE AND SPRING 

1) J2EE Web Application can be marked as distributed
2) If J2EE WAR file is not marked as distributed then it will not do Session replication
3) Servlet 3.0 allows bootstrapping of web application in a mixed mode it supports both web.xml and Java config

Spring MVC 
- @ControllerAdvice : Its an MVC annotation which is generally used as to advice Spring MVC Controllers before request and after response 
       Example usage : Core REST response body advice adds Location header to the response if this controller method creates a new resource                

-- SpringServletContainerInitializer
   This is the base class which is called by J2EE Web container when app server is started this class scans all jar files of WAR file and lists all classes
   which provide implementation for org.springframework.web.WebApplicationInitializer (Servlet 3.0)
  
--Spring Boot
  @Service("personService") - @Service annotation is autoScanned if componenetScan is enabled and are autoWired

Core JAVA
- CopyOnWriteArrayList 
  Is useful and we should use if most of the operations are iterations and it has very less modifications
  Example place to use - loading Envrionment variables and property files which often happens only once during start up of App server, rest of the time it only has reading
  It has better performance for Iterations over normal ArrayList iteration because it's fail Safe iterator does not worry about underlying collection being Modified
  does not throw concurrentModificationException
  
  Purpose of Copying to new Array for every add/set opertaion
  - Copying the underlying array guarantees that any iteration of the data structure is safe as the iteration is occurring over an essentially immutable 
    "snapshot" of the data.

-- JConsole or VisualVM are the profiling tools which are shipped along with JDK for profiling and collecting Heap or memory dump	
-- VisualVM
    from 1.6 JDK onwards java ships visualvm profiler with 
    you can profile the packages you wanted by customizing the packages defined under sampling tab

Declare D2 model packages as extended package and try if that improves performance since u should have the serialization of all those classes well in advance

 How to make sure that System-Properties configured in JBOSS is picked up by JBOSS App server
 
 Jboss provides an handy tool to read system properties set 
 
 jboss-cli.bat --connect controller=localhost:8090
/system-property=org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol.MAX_HEADER_SIZE:read-resource
/system-property=org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol.MAX_HEADER_SIZE:add(value=65536)
